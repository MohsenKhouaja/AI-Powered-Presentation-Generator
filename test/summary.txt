PantryPal is an AI-powered application designed to streamline home pantry management, reduce food waste, and offer personalized culinary guidance. It achieves this through four core functionalities:

1.  **AI-Powered Inventory Ingestion:** This feature makes adding groceries effortless. Users can scan a grocery receipt, and the system uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text. A custom AI script or Large Language Model (LLM) then parses and structures this text to identify items, quantities, and prices. Products are matched against a food database for standardization and shelf-life estimates, with users confirming the final list.
2.  **Dynamic Recipe & Meal Plan Generation:** PantryPal generates personalized meal ideas based on available ingredients and user preferences (e.g., dietary restrictions, cooking time, items nearing expiration). A fine-tuned LLM creates unique, easy-to-follow recipes, formatted for clear display, and allows users to deduct ingredients upon cooking.
3.  **The "PantryPal" AI Assistant (Chatbot):** This conversational chatbot enables full control of the app without navigating menus. Users can ask natural language questions (e.g., "Do I have any eggs left?", "Add bread to my shopping list?", "I feel like Italian tonight?"). The AI recognizes intent and executes functions like checking inventory, updating shopping lists, or triggering recipe generation, displaying responses in chat or as rich embedded cards.
4.  **Proactive & Actionable Expiration Alerts:** To prevent food waste, a daily background task scans inventory for items expiring within 1-3 days. An AI-powered suggestion generator (LLM) then creates contextual alerts, suggesting recipes that use the expiring items (e.g., "Your avocados are perfectly ripe! How about some fresh guacamole tonight?"). Tapping the push notification instantly opens the app to display the suggested recipe. When multiple items are expiring, the AI intelligently bundles them for joint recipe ideas.
